# Dirk's little stock ticker

This is a __very__ quick example of an Angular app that pulls some basic historical data for a stock ticker.  Doing a quick search let me to Polygon.io for a free API call.  And much to my surprise, they had a NPM package too (through it's pretty basic).  

## Things I would add

- Some design and animation 
- Unit testing
- Data Validation, stock ticker typeahead
- Performance optimizations (treeshaking unneeded JS/CSS)
- SEO stuff
- ADA/WCAG Accessibility Compliance
- Environment variables (api keys in git pipeline variables probably)
- GIT pipelines to test and deploy 
- Organize the code into folders and whatnot
- Testing would probably be good too
